#####  <span style="font-family: Cardo, ital; color:  #083462;">Description</span>

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or aerial drone refers to autonomous aircraft utilized in IUU fishing monitoring, equipped with cameras or sensors for real-time data collection. These drones aid in detecting IUU fishing activities by providing aerial surveillance over large marine areas that are difficult to monitor with traditional methods.

UAV endurance can range from less than 30 minutes for small consumer drones to over 10 hours for long-endurance drones used for maritime surveillance, allowing for extended monitoring missions. Tactical UAVs used for IUU fishing monitoring may have operational ranges from tens to hundreds of kilometers, depending on factors such as communication range, line of sight, and fuel/electricity limitations. UAVs used for maritime surveillance and IUU fishing monitoring can vary in size, impacting their payload capacity and endurance. Small UAVs, often referred to as “mini” or “micro” UAVs, may have wingspans of a few feet, while a larger tactical UAV can have wingspans exceeding 20 feet. While smaller consumer drones may weigh only a few grams, tactical UAVs suitable for IUU fishing monitoring typically fall within the range of tens to a few hundred kilograms.

#####  <span style="font-family: Cardo, ital; color:  #083462;">Monitoring Limitations</span>

Many UAVs have limited flight endurance, which can restrict the amount of time they can spend monitoring a specific area, resulting in gaps in surveillance, especially in large maritime zones. can only operate within certain altitudes and ranges, which can be a constraint when trying to cover vast ocean areas or monitoring vessels in remote locations. UAVs have both limited payload and sensor capacities, meaning that the types and number of sensors and equipment that can be carried is restricted when compared to larger, manned surveillance aircrafts or satellites, impacting the quality and variety of data collected.
