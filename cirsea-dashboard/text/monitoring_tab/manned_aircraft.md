#### **Manned Aircraft**

<br>

##### **Description**

Manned aircraft refers to piloted airplanes or helicopters, typically operated by law enforcement or monitoring agencies. These vessels are equipped with various sensors and surveillance technologies used to monitor IUU fishing, providing a broader perspective of large marine areas. Manned aircraft are operated by maritime domain awareness (MDA) organizations such as national coast guards and can detect vessel location and activity from a distance.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Depending on their intended mission and payload capacity, manned aircraft can range from smaller patrol aircraft, such as turboprop planes or light helicopters, to larger fixed-wing aircraft such as maritime patrol aircraft or surveillance planes. The weight of manned aircraft can vary significantly, as smaller patrol aircraft may weigh between a few thousand kilograms to tens of thousands of kilograms for larger maritime patrol aircraft. Endurance for maritime patrol aircraft can span between several hours to over 10-12 hours, and the range of manned aircraft can extend into thousands of nautical miles, depending on factors such as fuel efficiency, fuel capacity, and mission requirements.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Manned aircraft have finite fuel capacities that restrict their endurance, resulting in the need for frequent return to base for refueling, reducing continuous monitoring of IUU fishing activities. The considerable noise generated by manned aircraft and their visibility in the sky can alert IUU fishing vessels to clear the area before they can be inspected by authorities. Operating manned aircraft involves higher costs compared to unmanned systems due to personnel expenses that contribute to overall operating costs. Safety concerns may influence response strategies, as human crew members on board manned aircraft face potential risks, especially when dealing with potentially hostile or non-compliant IUU fishing vessels.
