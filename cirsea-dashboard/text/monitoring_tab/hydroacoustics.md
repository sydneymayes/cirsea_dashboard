#### **Hydrophone Array (Hydroacoustics)**

<br>

##### **Description**

An underwater device that detects acoustic signatures. An array of at least two hydrophones is needed to discern the direction a signal is coming from. A highly sensitive hydrophone array can discern vessel activity, and even specific vessel characteristics such as the engine or compressor type.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Hydrophone arrays can detect vessel presence within a range from one to 40+ km, depending on many factors such as hydrophone model, ocean depth, water temperature and salinity, and sound barriers. The size and weight of a hydrophone array is influenced by its design, components, materials, and desired spatial coverage. Hydrophone arrays can range from compact arrangements consisting of a few individual hydrophones weighing only a few kilograms each, to larger arrays spanning up to several kilometers and weighing thousands of kilograms. A hydrophone arrayâ€™s endurance can be influenced by factors such as battery life, power supply, and the robustness of the array components. Therefore, some hydrophone arrays may operate autonomously for weeks or months, while others may require regular maintenance or monitoring.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Hydrophone arrays detect a wide range of underwater sounds, making it challenging to distinguish between IUU fishing activities and other natural or anthropogenic noise sources, such as ship traffic or environmental sounds like waves, currents, and marine life. Hydrophone arrays have a finite spatial coverage, and deploying and maintaining multiple arrays to cover larger or remote areas can be resource-intensive, causing gaps in coverage that allow vessels engaged in IUU fishing to evade detection. 

The effective range of hydrophone arrays can be limited, especially in deep or turbulent waters, reducing their coverage area and ability to detect distant IUU fishing activities. Underwater conditions like temperature, salinity, and currents can affect the transmission of sound, potentially reducing the effectiveness of hydrophone arrays.
