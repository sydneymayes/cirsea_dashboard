#### **Automatic Identification System (AIS)**

<br>

##### **Description**

Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a maritime communication and tracking system designed to improve safety and security at sea. It uses satellite data to continuously broadcast information from vessels equipped with AIS transponders, allowing shore-based authorities and nearby vessels to track their movements in real time. 

<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

AIS data provides authorities with enhanced situational awareness, allowing them to identify patterns of vessel movements and detect suspicious behavior. AIS provides unique identification information for each equipped vessel, including its vessel name, call sign, Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number, and other details, which help authorities verify vessels’ identities. AIS allows for vessels to share their positions with nearby ships, reducing the risk of collision and contributing to overall maritime safety and security. Data from AIS technology can be integrated into broader monitoring systems and shared globally among fisheries management organizations, enhancing the ability to detect and monitor IUU fishing activities and promoting transparency at sea.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Small fishing vessels, often used in IUU activities, may not be required to carry AIS, or their signals may be less detectable due to the limited transmission range, making tracking and monitoring them more challenging. AIS provides information on vessel position, but is unable to relay the specific activities that a vessel is engaged in, so determining whether a vessel is involved in IUU fishing requires additional information and analysis.

#### **Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)**

<br>

##### **Description**

Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) are maritime surveillance systems that utilize satellite data to monitor and record the activities of fishing vessels. VMS records and transmits information on the precise location, speed, and course of fishing vessels, aiding in the identification of vessels that are in violation of or display patterns that may indicate a violation of regulations set by local fisheries management agencies.

<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

VMS are effective tools in monitoring IUU fishing by providing real-time location tracking of fishing vessels, enabling authorities to detect unauthorized fishing activities in restricted areas. VMS also aids in verifying vessel identities, monitoring vessel movements, and enforcing fishing regulations, contributing to improved transparency and accountability in the fishing industry.

<br>

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

The requirement for vessels to have VMS installed depends on various factors, including the country or region’s regulations, the size and type of the vessel, and the specific fisheries being targeted, so vessels may disable VMS in areas in which it is not required and engage in IUU fishing activities. VMS data alone may not be sufficient in verifying the true identity of vessels engaged in certain IUU fishing activities such as displaying a false flag or detecting vessels using prohibited gear.
