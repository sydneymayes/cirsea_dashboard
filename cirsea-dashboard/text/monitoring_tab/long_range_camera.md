#### **Long Range Cameras**

<br>

##### **Description**

A long-range camera refers to a high-resolution imaging device equipped with powerful zoom capabilities, often mounted on aircraft or satellites, used to capture detailed images of vessels at sea. These cameras enable authorities to identify and track vessels engaged in suspicious or illegal fishing activities from a considerable distance, enhancing surveillance and enforcement efforts.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

The range of a long-range camera used in IUU fishing can vary but typically extends from several kilometers to over 50 kilometers, depending on the specific model and configuration. In terms of weight, these cameras can range from a few kilograms to several hundred kilograms, depending on their size and capabilities. They can be as small as a handheld device or as large as a mounted system on aircraft or satellites. Endurance can range from a few hours to several days, again depending on the type and power source.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Despite their range, long-range cameras have limited fields of view, so they may not capture activities in all areas of interest simultaneously, requiring multiple cameras or repositioning. Natural and man-made obstructions such as islands, ships, or structures can obstruct the view of long-range cameras, limiting their ability to monitor certain areas effectively. While advancements have improved, the resolution of long-range cameras may not always be sufficient to capture detailed activities or identify small vessels, particularly at long distances.

#### **Other Cameras**

<br>

##### **Description**

Other types of cameras refer to cameras with limited optical zoom capabilities, typically used for close-range or onboard monitoring of fishing activities. These cameras are often installed on vessels to capture detailed images and videos of fishing operations, catch handling, and crew activities in closer proximity to the vessel. Unlike long-range cameras, which can capture images from significant distances, other types of cameras are designed for capturing finer details at closer ranges.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Other types of cameras that are not long-range used in IUU fishing monitoring typically weigh between 5 to 20 kilograms, with dimensions ranging from small handheld devices to larger fixed installations, such as those mounted on vessels. Its range is relatively limited compared to long-range cameras, usually up to a few hundred meters, and its endurance varies from a few hours to several days depending on power source and capacity. 


<br>

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Other types of cameras that are not long-range have a restricted field of view, often only capturing activities within a few hundred meters, which can result in gaps in surveillance coverage, especially for larger areas. These cameras may have limited battery life or need frequent recharging, impacting their continuous monitoring capability over extended periods. Due to their shorter range, non-long-range cameras might not capture fine details such as vessel identification numbers or specific gear types, making it challenging to identify illegal activities with precision.
