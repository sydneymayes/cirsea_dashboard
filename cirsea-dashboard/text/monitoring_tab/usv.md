#### **Unmanned Surface Vehices (USV) - Small**

<br>

##### **Description**

An unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is a remotely operated or autonomous watercraft equipped with various sensors that can be deployed to monitor and detect IUU fishing activities. Small USVs are lighter, slower, and cheaper than the larger models.

<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

They have a limited sensor payload capacity and travel at speeds up to 2 knots. Most models are equipped with solar or wave power, allowing for deployments of 3 to 12 months without the need for servicing. Small USVs can be combined with medium-range cameras to capture images and footage of vessel activity and hydrophone arrays to detect vessel acoustic signatures and location. Small USVs are well-suited to a predefined, small area patrol such as a marine protected area, harbor, or active fishing ground.  They could also serve as the “tip” in “tip-and-cue”: if the USV detects suspicious vessel activity, a manned patrol could intercept the vessel and investigate activity. 

<br>

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Small USVs are very slow and could not pursue a moving vessel. They are also not well-suited to act as the “cue” in “tip-and-cue” since the slow speeds limit their interception ability. Additionally, they are vulnerable to damage, either from harsh marine environments or bad actors. Finally, USVs have ongoing operational costs as well as maintenance needs that may require specialized skills or equipment.

#### **Unmanned Surface Vehices (USV) - Large**

<br>

##### **Description**

An unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is a remotely operated or autonomous watercraft equipped with various sensors that can be deployed to monitor and detect IUU fishing activities. Large USVs are characterized by their size, weight, and high cost. 

<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Larger USVs models have a greater payload capacity and can travel at speeds up to 10 knots. Most models are equipped with solar and/or wind power, allowing for deployments of 3 to 12 months. Large USVs can be equipped with medium- or long-range cameras to capture imagery of vessel activity and hydrophone arrays to detect vessel acoustic signatures and location. Large USVs are well-suited to patrol high-value regions such as a Marine Protected Area, harbor, or active fishing ground. Additionally, they can participate in “tip-and-cue” operations as either the “tip” or the “cue”. 

<br>

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

USVs are limited by their slow speeds; even fast models would not be able to keep in pursuit of a moving vessel. They are also vulnerable to damage from either harsh marine environments or bad actors. Finally, USVs have ongoing operational costs as well as maintenance needs that may require specialized skills or equipment.
