#### **Onshore Command Center**

<br>

##### **Description**

An onshore command center is a centralized facility located on land where data from various monitoring systems, such as satellites and drones, is received, analyzed, and used to coordinate enforcement actions against IUU fishing activities at sea. It serves as the hub for decision-making, communication with enforcement vessels, and strategic deployment of resources to combat IUU fishing.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

The range of an onshore command center in monitoring IUU fishing activities is not limited by physical distance in the same way that the range of a communication device or sensor might be. Instead, the effectiveness of an onboard command center is influenced by its ability to access and analyze information from various sources, often over extended geographic distances. The primary factors influencing the range of onshore command centers in monitoring IUU fishing activities include the availability and quality of data sources, satellite coverage, communication infrastructure, collaboration and information sharing, and analytical capabilities. The size of an onshore command center can vary widely depending on the scope of its operations, the extent of its responsibilities, and the level of resources dedicated to monitoring IUU fishing activities.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

The effectiveness of onshore command centers depends on the accuracy and quality of the data they receive, so inaccurate or incomplete information, or delays in data acquisition from sources that do not provide real-time information can lead to misinterpretations and impact IUU fishing monitoring abilities. Automated systems used for anomaly detection may generate false positives, leading to the investigation of non-threatening activities and diverting onshore command centersâ€™ resources away from actual IUU fishing incidents.
