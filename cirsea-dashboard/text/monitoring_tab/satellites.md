#### **Capella**

Capella provides high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with a cost per image. The Capella satellite can be tasked to take an image at a specified location which can be delivered within 5 hours or less. From Capella SAR imagery, a vessel’s length and width can be determined, and potentially the vessel type.

#### **MDA Radarsat**

Radarsat is a series of three Earth observation satellites developed by MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates) equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, making them valuable assets for monitoring various aspects of the Earth’s surface, including activities related to IUU fishing.

#### **Sentinel-1**

The Sentinel-1 satellite is part of the European Space Agency’s Copernicus program, designed to monitor Earth’s surface with radar imaging. Sentinel-1 provides valuable data for detecting IUU fishing activities by tracking vessel movements, even in remote areas or when vessels turn off their identification systems (AIS).

<br>

#### **Sentinel-2**

The Sentinel-2 satellite is a component of the European Space Agency’s Copernicus program, specializing in high-resolution optical imaging of Earth’s surface. Sentinel-2 aids in detecting IUU fishing activities by providing detailed images of coastal areas and identifying changes in coastal zones, such as the presence of unauthorized fishing vessels or suspicious activities near shorelines.

#### **Unseenlabs**

Unseenlabs satellite technology is a system that detects and tracks vessels by detecting and characterizing their passive electromagnetic signature. This technology can identify vessels even when they are not broadcasting their location via AIS or other tracking methods, enhancing surveillance and enforcement efforts against IUU fishing.

<br>

#### **Landsat**

The Landsat program consists of a series of Earth-observing satellite missions jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Landsat satellites can be used to monitor IUU fishing by capturing high-resolution images of the Earth’s surface, which can reveal illegal fishing activities such as vessel presence in restricted areas or suspicious behavior like transshipment at sea.

#### **Public Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)**

The Public Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a set of instruments that are part of satellite systems designed for environmental monitoring, primarily used for collecting data related to Earth’s surface, atmosphere and oceans. It operates across various spectral bands, including visible and infrared, and provides data that can be utilized in broad maritime surveillance efforts.
