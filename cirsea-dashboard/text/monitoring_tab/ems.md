##### **Description**

Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS) refer to a suite of technological tools and devices designed to electronically monitor and record fishing activities on vessels. These systems, which include high-resolution cameras and sensors, are used in fisheries management to provide accurate and verifiable data on fishing operations, catch handling processes, and vessel movements in order to monitor adherence to fishing regulations.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

EMS capture and store visual and environmental data securely and can transmit it in real time or at specified intervals, allowing authorities to promptly access information and detect instances of IUU fishing. Electronic monitoring systems often use GPS technology to track and record the precise location of vessels, which is essential for verifying compliance with fishing regulations. EMS log events such as gear deployments, hauls, and other fishing activities, reducing the need for human presence during inspections, which is particularly valuable for monitoring vessels in expansive or remote areas.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Some vessels may engage in selective reporting, complying with EMS requirements only during specific times or in certain areas, reducing the effectiveness of constant monitoring. EMS coverage may be limited in certain regions due to operational costs and resource constraints, or in remote or high seas areas, decreasing authorities’ ability to effectively monitor IUU fishing. Lack of standardization in EMS, combined with the fact that the systems may not be universally adaptable to all sizes and types of fishing vessels, can hinder interoperability and data-sharing efforts, reducing the technology’s effectiveness.
