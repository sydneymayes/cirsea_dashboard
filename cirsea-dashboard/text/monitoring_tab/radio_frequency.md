#### **Radio Frequency (RF)**

<br>

##### **Description**

Radio frequency (RF) is an electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range between 30 kHz and 300 GHz and is used for radio communications. An RF receiver can pick up signals from any vessel using radio communication, even if its AIS/VMS transmitter is disabled.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

The range of RF monitoring systems depends on factors such as the frequency band used, transmission power, antenna design, and environmental conditions, spanning a few kilometers to tens or hundreds of kilometers, allowing for monitoring over larger maritime domains or from satellite platforms. RF monitoring equipment ranges from compact receivers weighing only a few kilograms for portable applications that can be easily deployed on vessels or shore-based platforms, to larger installations weighing several hundred kilograms or more with antennas or arrays mounted on towers, buoys, or buildings for fixed or mobile monitoring stations. Portable RF receivers may operate on battery power for several hours or days before requiring recharging or replacement, while fixed installations powered by mains electricity or solar panels can operate indefinitely, provided they are adequately maintained and serviced.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

RF monitoring systems have finite coverage areas determined by factors such as transmission power, antenna placement, and environmental conditions, so monitoring wide maritime domains may require deploying multiple RF stations or relying on other surveillance technologies to fill coverage gaps. RF signals can be interfered with by other radio signals, electronic devices, or natural sources of electromagnetic noise, or blocked by obstacles such as stationary built structures, terrain, or other vessels, limiting the effectiveness of RF monitoring in areas with rugged coastlines or heavily congested maritime zones. RF monitoring systems may lack the resolution and accuracy required to precisely locate vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities, reducing the ability to locate the exact position of a vessel based solely on RF signals.
