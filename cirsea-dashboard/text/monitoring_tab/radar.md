#### **Radar**

<br>

##### **Description**

Radar refers to a detection system that uses radio waves to track vessels on the ocean’s surface, allowing authorities to monitor vessel movements and potentially identify suspicious or illegal fishing activities. It operates by transmitting radio waves and then detecting the reflected signals from vessels, providing information on their location, speed, and direction.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Radar systems used to monitor IUU fishing may operate continuously for hours, days or even weeks, depending on their power source and reliability, which can be influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, maintenance schedules, and power consumption. IUU fishing detection radars may have short-range capabilities suitable for coastal surveillance, or long-range capabilities able to find targets hundreds of kilometers away for monitoring offshore areas and maritime borders. The range of a radar used to monitor IUU fishing is influenced by factors such as transmitter power, antenna size, and atmospheric conditions.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

Radar coverage is limited by the curvature of the Earth, meaning that it may not detect vessels beyond a certain range, especially in areas with rough terrain or islands that obstruct the radar’s line of sight. Radar may struggle to detect small or low-profile vessels, such as small fishing boats operating without radar reflectors. Radar signals can be affected by other vessels’ radar transmissions or land-based structures, leading to false readings or reduced clarity in crowded or busy maritime areas.
