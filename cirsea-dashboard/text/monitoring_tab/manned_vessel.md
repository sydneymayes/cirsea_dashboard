#### **Manned Vessel**

<br>

##### **Description**

Manned vessel refers to a crewed watercraft used in IUU fishing monitoring, typically operated by law enforcement or monitoring agencies. These vessels are equipped with various technologies and personnel for surveillance and inspection, and have the advantage of eye-witness accounts to any illegal activity.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Manned vessels involved in IUU fishing monitoring can range from smaller patrol boats weighing a few tons and spanning between a few meters to tens of meters, to larger vessels such as coast guard or naval vessels that can weigh several hundred or even thousands of tons and have lengths exceeding 100 meters. The endurance of manned vessels can vary, as smaller patrol boats may have a shorter endurance, typically measured in days, while larger vessels with greater fuel and supply capacities can remain at sea for weeks or even months. The range of a manned vessel depends on factors such as vessel speed, fuel efficiency, and overall fuel capacity, and spans between hundreds of nautical miles for smaller patrol boats to thousands of nautical miles for larger vessels.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

The finite operational ranges and capacities of manned vessels, combined with the need for them to return to port periodically, may be a challenge when dealing with IUU fishing activities that occur in remote or deep-sea areas. While equipped with radar and sonar, manned vessels may have limitations in terms of surveillance technologies compared to unmanned systems, particularly in densely populated or constrained maritime environments. Human safety is a critical consideration, as crew members on manned vessels face risks associated with patrolling and confronting potentially hostile or non-compliant IUU fishing vessels.
