#### **Onboard Observers**

<br>

##### **Description**

An onboard observer refers to a person stationed on a fishing vessel to monitor and report fishing activities. They collect data on catch, fishing practices, and compliance with regulations, providing real-time information to authorities to combat illegal fishing. 


<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Onboard observers provide real-time monitoring by physically being present on vessels, allowing them to directly witness and document activities and detect instances of IUU fishing. Onboard observers' task of monitoring fishing vessels also includes documenting and reporting information to regulatory authorities, and verifying data from logbook entries made by vessel operators in order to ensure that vessels are operating within regulatory boundaries.

##### **Monitoring Limitations**

[Training observers can be costly](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/18/10231) and there is not always space to accommodate observers on vessels. If there is capacity, it can still be hard to get the proper amount of observer coverage necessary and it can also be difficult to ensure observer safety on vessels.
