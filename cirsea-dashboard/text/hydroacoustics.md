#### **Hydrophone Array (Hydroacoustics)**

<br>

##### **Description**

A hydrophone is an underwater microphone that detects and records acoustic signatures. An array of at least two hydrophones is needed to discern the direction a signal is coming from.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Hydrophone arrays can be valuable tools to detect instances of IUU fishing, including unreported bottom trawling, illegal anchoring in a restricted area, incidental catch of protected species, and gear-related offenses such as illegal drift netting, use of explosives, unregulated use of acoustic devices, and ghost gear, as well as patterns that could signal possible IUU fishing activities.

Hydrophone arrays can detect vessel presence within a range from one to 40+ km, depending on many factors such as hydrophone model, ocean depth, water temperature and salinity, and sound barriers. The size and weight of a hydrophone array is influenced by its design, components, materials, and desired spatial coverage. Hydrophone arrays can range from compact arrangements consisting of a few individual hydrophones weighing only a few kilograms each, to larger arrays spanning up to several kilometers and weighing thousands of kilograms. A hydrophone arrayâ€™s endurance can be influenced by factors such as battery life, power supply, and the robustness of the array components. Therefore, some hydrophone arrays may operate autonomously for weeks or months, while others may require regular maintenance or monitoring.
