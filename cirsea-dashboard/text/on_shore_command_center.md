#### **Onshore Command Center**

<br>

##### **Description**

Maritime domain awareness organizations operate out of command centers onshore that analyze intelligence from various sensors and use this information to plan enforcement strategies. 

<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Onshore command centers use a combination of technologies, data analysis, and coordination to oversee and respond to suspicious activities at sea. The types of IUU fishing activities that onshore command centers can be used to monitor include illegal gear deployment, bycatch violations, unreported fishing catch and effort, unauthorized entry into prohibited zones, quota violations, vessel identification and registration violations, and illegal transshipments at sea. 

The range of an onshore command center in monitoring IUU fishing activities is not limited by physical distance in the same way that the range of a communication device or sensor might be. Instead, the effectiveness of an onboard command center is influenced by its ability to access and analyze information from various sources, often over extended geographic distances. The primary factors influencing the range of onshore command centers in monitoring IUU fishing activities include the availability and quality of data sources, satellite coverage, communication infrastructure, collaboration and information sharing, and analytical capabilities. The size of an onshore command center can vary widely depending on the scope of its operations, the extent of its responsibilities, and the level of resources dedicated to monitoring IUU fishing activities.
