*Instructions:*

To begin, choose an IUU event of interest and select a jurisdiction for monitoring. 

<br>

The data generated will include sensor + platform monitoring strategies. Numeric values associated with each strategy represent the **estimated range (in km)** at which an IUU event can be detected. You may also filter by **cost** and **data/evidence** interests to refine results.

<br>

Descriptions of monitoring strategies will appear below the table. More detailed information about the strategies as well as IUU types are found on the other tabs of this app.
