#### **Illegal Transhipments**

<br>

##### **Description**

Illegal transshipments occur when vessels transfer unauthorized catches or when vessel transfers are unrecorded. Transshipments alone are not illegal, but IUU actors will often use transshipments to move illegally caught fish and/or carry out transshipments without proper documentation. A common example of illegal transshipment is a “dark rendezvous,” in which either one or multiple vessels turn off their VMS and/or AIS technology to avoid detection.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Illegal transshipments are particularly difficult to monitor because participating vessels frequently employ covert practices to avoid detection. These include disabling AIS or VMS trackers, conducting transshipments at night, or changing vessel identities. IUU actors can take advantage of complex supply chains or flag state jurisdiction laws to engage in illegal transshipments. Additionally, many fisheries face resource constraints that limit their availability to identify and track illegal transshipments.
