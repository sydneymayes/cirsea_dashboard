#### **Fishing without a License**

<br>  

##### **Description**

IUU actors will sometimes fish without proper authorization from the relevant management authorities. This includes fishing without a license altogether, or falsifying papers to give the appearance of legitimacy. Fishing licenses (permits) are issued by governments or regulatory bodies that grant vessels the legal rights to fish during designated periods, in specific waters, for specific species. Fishing without a valid license threatens sustainable fisheries management.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Information gaps and jurisdictional ambiguity, compounded by other IUU fishing offenses, make it difficult to ensure vessels have proper documentation. Incomplete license records make it challenging to distinguish between legal and illegal fishing activities, while overlapping regulations and a lack of international cooperation complicate monitoring in transboundary waters. Moreover, vessels can alter their identities or use multiple aliases to avoid detection, impeding efforts to monitor who is fishing without a license.
