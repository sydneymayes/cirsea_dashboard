#### **Radar**

<br>

##### **Description**

Radar uses radio waves to determine the distance, angle, and radial velocity of objects relative to the transmitter.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Radar technology can be employed to monitor various types of IUU fishing activities, such as unauthorized entry into restricted areas, use of illegal gear, illegal transshipments at sea, and detect IUU fishing hotspots. 

Radar systems used to monitor IUU fishing may operate continuously for hours, days or even weeks, depending on their power source and reliability, which can be influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, maintenance schedules, and power consumption. IUU fishing detection radars may have short-range capabilities suitable for coastal surveillance, or long-range capabilities able to find targets hundreds of kilometers away for monitoring offshore areas and maritime borders. The range of a radar used to monitor IUU fishing is influenced by factors such as transmitter power, antenna size, and atmospheric conditions.
