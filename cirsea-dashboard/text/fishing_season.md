#### **Fishing Out of Season**

<br>

##### **Description**

Fishing out of season occurs when vessels fish during time periods prohibited by fishery regulations. Fishing regulations will often permit certain activities during designated seasons or time frames in an effort to protect species during critical life stages, prevent overfishing, or manage stocks sustainably.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Monitoring fishing out of season requires a clear understanding of the specific timing and regulations associated with each fishery, which can vary widely. Fishing out of season can be challenging to monitor due to inconsistent regulations, overlapping jurisdictions, and a lack of international cooperation.
