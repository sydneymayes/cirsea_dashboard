#### **Smart Buoy**

<br>

##### **Description**

Floating platforms that can host a variety of sensors and can transmit information via satellite communication. Smart buoys can provide continuous monitoring, with a detection area dependent on the sensor package.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Smart buoys, equipped with various sensors and communication technologies, can be employed to monitor several types of IUU fishing, including unauthorized entry into restricted zones, illegal gear use, bycatch violations, unreported fishing catch and effort, vessel identification, and illegal transshipments.

Smart buoys can vary in size depending on their intended deployment and the types of sensors and equipment they carry, ranging from compact, easily deployable models to larger buoys designed to support a more extensive array of monitoring tools. The endurance of a smart buoy can range from days to months, depending on factors such as energy efficiency, power source (solar, batteries), and the type of monitoring tasks performed. A smart buoyâ€™s weight is influenced by its design, construction materials, and the payload it carries, ranging in size from a few kilograms to several dozen kilograms depending on the size and complexity of the monitoring equipment onboard. The range of a smart buoy is influenced by communication capabilities, such as satellite or radio frequency communication, and may vary from short-range deployments to buoys capable of transmitting data over long distances.
