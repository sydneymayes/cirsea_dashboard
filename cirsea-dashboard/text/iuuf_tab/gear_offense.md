#### **Gear-related Offense**

<br> 

##### **Description**

Gear-related offenses refer to illegal activities involving the use, modification, or deployment of fishing gear that violates established regulations or conservation measures. These offenses include using prohibited gear, modifying gear to bypass regulations, abandoning fishing gear (ghost gear), and using gear in restricted areas.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Vessels may employ dynamic or adaptive fishing tactics, changing gear types to evade monitoring efforts. IUU fishing operators often hide illegal gear or dump it overboard when approached by authorities, making it difficult for authorities to identify and document violations. IUU fishing operators may use technology to evade detection of illegal gear, such as deploying gear in areas with limited surveillance coverage or using equipment that does not emit detectable signals. Monitoring gear-related offenses requires specialized expertise and detailed information in order to identify different equipment and their unauthorized use, facilitating the need for onboard observers or inspections to detect, which may be restricted.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect gear-related offenses in the context of IUU fishing, several types of information are necessary, including documentation of permitted fishing gear types and specifications, records of gear inspections, reports of gear loss or damage, and monitoring data on gear deployments and retrieval.
