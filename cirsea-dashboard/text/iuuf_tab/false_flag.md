#### **Vessel Identity Changes**

<br>

##### **Description**

Vessel identity changes refer to instances where fishing vessels alter their registration, name, or flag to evade detection or enforcement measures. These changes can make it difficult to track the history and activities of the vessel, allowing it to engage in IUU fishing practices with reduced risk of identification and prosecution. Additionally, vessel owners will often register their vessel under the flag of a country with lenient maritime regulations, known as a “flag of convenience”, in order to engage in IUU fishing activities with a reduced chance of detection or enforcement.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Monitoring vessel identity changes presents challenges such as the need for real-time data on vessel registration and ownership and the difficulty in tracking changes in vessel names and flags. Additionally, the lack of transparency in vessel registration systems can further complicate efforts to monitor and verify vessel identities.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect vessel identity changes, authorities rely on real-time data on vessel registration and ownership, historical records of vessel names and registration numbers, information on changes in ownership and management, access to international databases for verification, transparency in registration systems, satellite imagery for monitoring movements, and reports from observers or whistleblowers.
