#### **Dark Vessels (not broadcasting location via VMS/AIS)**

<br>

##### **Description**

Failure to operate VMS/AIS refers to the illegal act of not using or tampering with vessel monitoring systems (VMS) or automatic identification systems (AIS), which are essential for monitoring fishing vessel movements. Failure to operate VMS/AIS includes actions such as uninstalling or deactivating the system, failing to transmit the required information, tampering with the system to display a false location, disabling VMS in order to commit an illegal act, and general negligence or ignorance.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Monitoring the failure to operate VMS presents a significant challenge due to the inherent difficulty in identifying the absence of a transmission. This lack of transmission makes it challenging to distinguish between a vessel that legitimately lost signal due to technical issues and one deliberately evading detection, creating a loophole that IUU fishers exploit. VMS is not universally mandated by all fisheries management authorities globally, allowing some vessels to disable their VMS in areas that do not mandate the technology or engage in IUU fishing without being subject to VMS monitoring. Some vessel operators cite privacy concerns as a reason for not operating VMS, making it a challenge to balance transparency with privacy rights.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect failure to operate VMS/AIS, information such as VMS/AIS data records, vessel tracking history, inspection reports, and satellite imagery would be necessary.
