#### **Illegal Transhipments**

<br>

##### **Description**

Illegal transshipments occur when vessels transfer unauthorized or unreported catch or fuel. Transshipments alone are not always illegal, but IUU fishing perpetrators will often use transshipments to move illegally caught fish or carry out transshipments without proper documentation, making the fish transferred extremely difficult to trace.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Illegal catch can be laundered through legitimate supply chains during transshipment, making it hard to differentiate between legally and illegally caught seafood. IUU operators may engage in corrupt practices, including bribery of officials, to facilitate illegal transshipments, further complicating monitoring efforts.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect illegal transshipments various types of information are required, including vessel tracking data from VMS or AIS, port entry and exit records, inspection reports, catch documentation, and satellite imagery. This data helps authorities identify suspicious vessel activities such as rendezvous at sea, prolonged stops in remote areas, or discrepancies in reported catches.
