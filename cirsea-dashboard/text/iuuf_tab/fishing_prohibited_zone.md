#####  <span style="font-family: Cardo, ital; color:  #083462;">Description</span>

Fishing in a prohibited zone occurs when vessels engage in fishing activities where fishing is restricted or forbidden by national or international regulations. Prohibited areas can include conservation zones, marine protected areas (MPAs), regions designated for endangered species, and regions where certain fishing practices are banned to protect the ecosystem.

Prohibited zones can change due to regulatory developments or environmental factors, requiring constant updates to monitoring systems and databases. Vessels engaged in IUU fishing may fish slightly outside of a prohibited zone and dart in and out in order to evade detection.

#####  <span style="font-family: Cardo; color:  #083462;">Information Needed to Detect</span>

To detect fishing in a prohibited zone, various types of information are needed, including accurate geospatial data on prohibited zones, VMS or AIS data showing vessel positions, satellite imagery to verify vessel location, and historical fishing activity data.
