#### **Underreporting of Fishing Catch**

<br>

##### **Description**

Underreporting of fishing catch refers to the deliberate misrepresentation or omission of the quantity and species of fish caught by vessels. This practice undermines fisheries management efforts, distorts stock assessments, and facilitates illegal fishing activities by masking the true impact on fish populations.

<br>

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Illegal transshipments obscure information about how much fish was caught and where, as vessels engaged in IUU fishing may offload fish caught above quota to other vessels. IUU fishing vessels may maintain falsified logbooks, providing misleading information on catch compositions and volume, complicating efforts to accurately assess their activities. The lack of comprehensive monitoring at ports and landing sites allows IUU fishing operators to underreport catches when they are offloaded, leading to gaps in records. 

<br>

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect underreporting of fishing catch, various types of information are needed, including accurate and comprehensive data on reported catch, landing, and sales; vessel monitoring data to track vessel movements and fishing activities; information on fishing gear types and capacity; and documentation of fishing licenses and permits.
