#### **Fishing Above Quota**

<br>

##### **Description**

Fishing above quota occurs when vessels exceed legally-established catch limits, which are set by fishery managers based on scientific assessments of fish stocks in an effort to ensure that stocks remain sustainable. When vessels exceed set quotas, it affects fish stock data, undermining efforts to manage fish populations and potentially leading to significant ecological and economic consequences.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

IUU operators may mix fish caught above quota with legally caught fish, exploiting complex supply chains to launder overfished catch into legal markets. Without the presence of an onboard observer, photographic evidence, or in-person catch surveys, it is incredibly difficult to monitor fishing above quota.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect fishing above quota, various types of information is needed, including knowledge of specific quota limits for the targeted species, reported catch data, vessel tracking data from VMS or AIS, satellite imagery to observe vessel activities, and onboard observer reports of fishing activities and catch quantities.
