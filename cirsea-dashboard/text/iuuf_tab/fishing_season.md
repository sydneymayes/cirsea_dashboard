#### **Fishing Out of Season**

<br>

##### **Description**

Fishing out of season occurs when vessels fish during time periods prohibited by fishery regulations. Fishing regulations will often permit certain activities during designated seasons or time frames in an effort to protect species during critical life stages, prevent overfishing, or manage stocks sustainably.


<br>

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Monitoring fishing out of season requires a clear understanding of the specific timing and regulations associated with each fishery, which can vary widely. IUU operators may exploit these variations to fish during periods when regulations prohibit it.

<br>

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect fishing out of season, relevant information includes fisheries regulations and seasons for the specific species, vessel tracking data from VMS or AIS, catch reports, satellite imagery to monitor vessel activities, and possibly onboard observer reports.
