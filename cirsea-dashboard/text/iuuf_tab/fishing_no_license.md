#### **Fishing without a License**

<br>  

##### **Description**

Fishing without a license occurs when vessel operators fish without proper authorization from the relevant management authorities. This includes fishing without a license altogether, or falsifying papers to give the appearance of legitimacy. Fishing licenses are issued by governments or regulatory bodies that grant vessels the legal rights to fish during designated periods, in specific waters, for specific species and quantities.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Fishing without a license often goes hand in hand with underreporting of fishing catch, as IUU fishing vessel operators engaging in this practice may not submit any catch information to fisheries authorities, further complicating efforts to monitor their activities. IUU operators may change the names of their vessels or flags frequently to avoid detection. This practice, known as “flag hopping,” makes it challenging to track vessels with a history of fishing without a license.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect fishing without a license, relevant information includes the list of licensed vessels, verification of vessel licenses and permits, vessel tracking data from VMS or AIS, comparison of vessel activities with authorized fishing zones, catch reports, and possibly onboard observer reports.
