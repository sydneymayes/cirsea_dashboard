#### **Underreporting of Fishing Effort**

<br>

##### **Description**

Underreporting of fishing effort occurs when vessels fail to accurately document or report their fishing activities. Vessels may deliberately provide incomplete or misleading information about their locations, target species, or catch. 


<br>

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Ensuring fishing effort is accurately reported requires officers to verify a vessel's stated fishing activities which is extremely difficult without onboard observers. Additionally, there are safety considerations for independent onboard observers or employed fishermen who report illegal activity. Onboard personnel may face threats of job loss or even physical harm if they are caught reporting IUU fishing activities such as underreporting of fishing effort to authorities.

##### **Information Needed to Detect**

To detect underreporting of fishing effort, detailed information about onboard activity is needed. Specifically, practitioners would need to know the amount of time spent fishing using specific gear (e.g., number of hours trawled per day) compared to the amount reported.
