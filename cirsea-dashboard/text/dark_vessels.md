#### **Dark Vessels (not broadcasting location via VMS/AIS)**

<br>

##### **Description**

Many states require fishing vessels to operate a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) that transmits temporal, geographic, and identification data. VMS utilizes satellites to provide authorities with real-time data on vessel speed, course, and location to ensure compliance with fishing regulations. Vessels that fail to operate VMS can do so in a variety of ways, including uninstalling or deactivating the system, failing to transmit the required information, and general negligence or ignorance.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Authorities rely on VMS data to track vessels and identify potential IUU activities, and the absence of such data creates significant surveillance gaps. IUU actors may exploit jurisdictional complexities by operating in areas where multiple countries share monitoring responsibilities. This, combined with a lack of data when VMS is disabled or inaccurate, makes it difficult for states to accurately monitor vessel activity â€“ legal and illegal.
