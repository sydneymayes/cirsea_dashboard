#### **Underreporting of Fishing Catch**

<br>

##### **Description**

Underreporting of fishing catch occurs vessels fail to report some or all of their catch to the relevant authorities.

<br>

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Ensuring catch data is accurately reported requires the ability to cross-check vesselsâ€™ fishing activities. The use of illegal or unregulated gear can make it difficult to accurately quantify catch, while offenses like transshipments obscure information about how much fish was caught and where. Additionally, many fisheries face resource constraints that limit their availability to verify catch, either in-person or remotely.
