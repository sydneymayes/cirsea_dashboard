##### **Description**

A remotely piloted aircraft equipped with various technologies that gather real-time information in order to monitor and combat IUU fishing activities.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Drones can cover large areas efficiently and provide authorities with valuable data to promptly identify and track vessels engaged in IUU fishing. UAVs can be used to monitor various IUU fishing activities, such as unauthorized fishing in restricted areas, illegal gear and methods, quota violations, underreporting and mislabeling, and transshipment at sea, even in low-light conditions.

UAV endurance can range from less than 30 minutes for small consumer drones to over 10 hours for long-endurance drones used for maritime surveillance, allowing for extended monitoring missions. Tactical UAVs used for IUU fishing monitoring may have operational ranges from tens to hundreds of kilometers, depending on factors such as communication range, line of sight, and fuel/electricity limitations. UAVs used for maritime surveillance and IUU fishing monitoring can vary in size, impacting their payload capacity and endurance. Small UAVs, often referred to as “mini” or “micro” UAVs, may have wingspans of a few feet, while a larger tactical UAV can have wingspans exceeding 20 feet. While smaller consumer drones may weigh only a few grams, tactical UAVs suitable for IUU fishing monitoring typically fall within the range of tens to a few hundred kilograms.
