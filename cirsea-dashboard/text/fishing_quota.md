#### **Fishing Above Quota**

<br>

##### **Description**

Fishing above quota occurs when vessels exceed legally-established catch limits. These limits, or quotas, are set by fishery managers based on scientific assessments of fish stocks in an effort to restrict the total amount of fish that can be harvested. Fishing above quota is detrimental to efforts to sustainably manage fish stocks, and has contributed to fishery declines across the world.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

In order to detect fishing above quota, states need reliable and timely information on which fish are caught, when, and where. Without the presence of an onboard observer, photographic evidence, or in-person catch surveys, it is incredibly difficult to monitor overfishing. Other IUU offenses, like transshipments or failure to operate a VMS, can further obscure catch information required to identify and persecute fishing above quota.
