#### **Unmanned Surface Vehices (USV)**

<br>

##### **Description**

A remotely operated or autonomous watercraft equipped with various sensors, cameras, and technology that can be deployed to monitor, detect, and combat IUU fishing activities. 

<br>

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

USVs can be used to monitor various types of IUU fishing activities, including unauthorized fishing, overfishing, illegal gear use, transshipment at sea, unreported fishing, fishing in restricted areas, bycatch and discarding, and vessels operating under false identities.

Depending on mission requirements, USVs used for IUU fishing monitoring may have ranges that vary from tens to hundreds of nautical miles. While the size of USVs can range from compact and portable models to larger vessels, USVs used to monitor IUU fishing vary from a few feet to several meters in length. The weight of USVs used for IUU fishing applications can range from a few kilograms to several hundred kilograms, depending on the size and payload. Endurance for USVs used to monitor IUU fishing can vary widely, ranging from a few hours to several days, depending on the energy source (batteries, fuel cells, etc.) and the specific mission requirements.
