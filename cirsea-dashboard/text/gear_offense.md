#### **Gear-related Offense**

<br> 

##### **Description**

Gear-related offenses occur when vessels use unauthorized fishing gear. These offenses include using prohibited gear, modifying gear to bypass regulations, and using gear in restricted areas.


<br>

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Monitoring gear-related offenses can be challenging due to the expertise and/or technology needed to identify different equipment and their unauthorized use. Vessels may employ dynamic or adaptive fishing tactics, changing gear types to evade monitoring efforts. Transshipments can also facilitate the exchange of illegal or unregulated gear. Additionally, many fisheries face resource constraints that limit their availability to identify or persecute gear-related offenses.
