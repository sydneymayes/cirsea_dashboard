##### **Manned Aircraft**

*Description:* Manned aircraft are often equipped with various sensors and surveillance technologies to gather information, employing human crews onboard piloted by trained aviators who are responsible for the navigation, control, and operation of the aircraft, providing a broader perspective of large marine areas. Manned aircraft are operated by maritime domain awareness (MDA) organizations such as national coast guards and can detect vessel location and activity from a distance.
