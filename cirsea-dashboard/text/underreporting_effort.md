#### **Underreporting of Fishing Effort**

<br>

##### **Description**

Underreporting of fishing effort occurs when vessels fail to accurately document or report their fishing activities. Vessels may deliberately provide incomplete or misleading information about their locations, target species, or catch. Transgressions include engaging in unauthorized activities, violating fishing regulations, and failing to disclose catches to the relevant authorities.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Ensuring fishing effort is accurately reported requires officers to verify vesselsâ€™ stated activities. Cross-checking effort is further complicated by IUU offenses like transshipments, which contribute to underreporting and can be difficult to detect. Additionally, many fisheries face resource constraints that limit their availability to monitor IUU fishing, either in-person or remotely, allowing more vessels to underreport fishing effort without consequences.
