##### **Description**

An individual or entity equipped with handheld devices, cameras, binoculars, or communication equipment and tasked with observing and reporting fishing activities, particularly vessels suspected of engaging in IUU fishing, within close proximity to the target vessels or fishing operations. Nearby observers play a crucial role in gathering real-time information, collecting evidence, and providing situational awareness to authorities responsible for monitoring vessels’ adherence fisheries’ regulations.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Nearby observers can be used to monitor various types of IUU fishing, such as fishing in restricted areas, illegal gear deployment, non-compliance with fishing quotas, unreported fishing catch and effort, IUU transshipments, gear interactions with protected species (bycatch/ghost gear), and non-compliance with vessel monitoring requirements.

The size of a group of nearby observers can range from individual observers or small teams deployed on vessels, aircraft, or coastal stations to larger observer programs involving multiple personnel and resources. Nearby observers may operate for several hours or days, depending on factors such as crew rotation, fuel capacity, and mission duration. Shore-based observers may have longer endurance periods, with continuous monitoring capabilities supported by infrastructure and logistics.
