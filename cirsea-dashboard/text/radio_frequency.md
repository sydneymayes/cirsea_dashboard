#### **Radio Frequency (RF)**

<br>

##### **Description**

Radio frequency (RF) is an electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range between 30 kHz and 300 GHz and is used for radio communications. An RF receiver can pick up signals from any vessel using radio communication, even if its AIS/VMS transmitter is disabled.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Some types of IUU fishing that RF can be used to monitor include unauthorized vessel entry, vessel identification and registration, use of illegal fishing gear, transshipment at sea, VMS compliance, and identification of IUU fishing hotspots and patterns that could indicate possible IUU fishing violations.  

The range of RF monitoring systems depends on factors such as the frequency band used, transmission power, antenna design, and environmental conditions, spanning a few kilometers to tens or hundreds of kilometers, allowing for monitoring over larger maritime domains or from satellite platforms. RF monitoring equipment ranges from compact receivers weighing only a few kilograms for portable applications that can be easily deployed on vessels or shore-based platforms, to larger installations weighing several hundred kilograms or more with antennas or arrays mounted on towers, buoys, or buildings for fixed or mobile monitoring stations. Portable RF receivers may operate on battery power for several hours or days before requiring recharging or replacement, while fixed installations powered by mains electricity or solar panels can operate indefinitely, provided they are adequately maintained and serviced.
