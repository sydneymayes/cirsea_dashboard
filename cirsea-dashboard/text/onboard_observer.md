#### **Onboard Observers**

<br>

##### **Description**

Human onboard observers are employed on vessels to collect data and create reports that provide information on fishing compliance. Tasks include logging catch and species types and recording violations. Levels of required observer coverage on vessels are set by RFMOs or national government agencies (MSC, 2024).

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Onboard observers provide real-time monitoring by physically being present on vessels, allowing them to directly witness and document activities and detect instances of IUU fishing. Human observers can verify catch composition, monitor improper gear usage and bycatch, and ensure adherence to fishing quotas, confirming that fishing vessels are operating within regulatory guidelines and helping authorities track suspicious activity. Onboard observers' task of monitoring fishing vessels also includes documenting and reporting information to regulatory authorities, and verifying data from logbook entries made by vessel operators in order to ensure that vessels are operating within regulatory boundaries.
