#### **Fishing in a Prohibited Zone**

<br>

##### **Description**

Fishing in a prohibited zone – e.g., engaging in fishing activities where fishing is restricted or forbidden by national or international regulations – is one of the more concrete IUU offenses to monitor. Prohibited areas can include conservation zones, marine protected areas (MPAs), regions designated for endangered species, and regions where certain fishing practices are banned to protect the ecosystem.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Prohibited zones, especially in isolated areas, may have limited surveillance coverage or a lack of monitoring infrastructure, making it difficult to detect infractions. Vessels can also take action to reduce the risk of being detected in prohibited areas, such as disabling AIS or VMS trackers, altering vessel identities, or fishing at nighttime. Smaller, agile fishing vessels are also difficult to monitor as they can easily navigate prohibited zones and avoid detection by surveillance vessels. Additionally, many fisheries face resource constraints that limit their availability to identify and track fishing in a prohibited zone.
