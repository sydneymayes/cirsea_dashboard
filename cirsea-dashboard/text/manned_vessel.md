#### **Manned Vessel**

<br>

##### **Description**

Manned vessels are operated by maritime domain awareness (MDA) organizations such as national coast guards. Manned patrols have the advantage of eye-witness accounts to any illegal activity and enforcement capabilities.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

Various types of IUU fishing can be effectively monitored using manned vessels, including unauthorized fishing in a prohibited area, illegal gear use, overfishing, unreported fishing catch, transshipment at sea, vessel identification and registration, and bycatch violations.

Manned vessels involved in IUU fishing monitoring can range from smaller patrol boats weighing a few tons and spanning between a few meters to tens of meters, to larger vessels such as coast guard or naval vessels that can weigh several hundred or even thousands of tons and have lengths exceeding 100 meters. The endurance of manned vessels can vary, as smaller patrol boats may have a shorter endurance, typically measured in days, while larger vessels with greater fuel and supply capacities can remain at sea for weeks or even months. The range of a manned vessel depends on factors such as vessel speed, fuel efficiency, and overall fuel capacity, and spans between hundreds of nautical miles for smaller patrol boats to thousands of nautical miles for larger vessels.
