#### **Vessel with False Flag**

<br>

##### **Description**

A vessel’s flag signals its nationality, as well as the legal and regulatory framework under which it operates. Displaying a flag associated with a state other than the country in which a vessel is registered is known as displaying a “false flag.” Similarly, boatowners will often register their vessels under the flag of a country with lenient maritime regulations, known as a “flag of convenience.” Vessels display false flags or utilize flags of convenience to avoid complying with proper regulations, or to hide the vessel’s identification. As such, flag-related offenses undermine regulations that protect fisheries and fishermen alike.

##### **Monitoring Challenges**

Monitoring vessels operating under false flags or flags of convenience requires multijurisdictional cooperation. Flag-related disputes involve at least two states – and potentially many more, if a vessel frequently changes its flag to evade detection or if multiple entities share monitoring responsibilities for a given area. Limitations in tracking or monitoring vessels, such as gaps in satellite coverage, further complicate efforts to properly identify vessels. Between the logistical and jurisdictional complexity of detecting false flags and flags of convenience, enforcing against flag-related offenses is often challenging.
