#### **Manned Aircraft**

<br>

##### **Description**

Manned aircraft are often equipped with various sensors and surveillance technologies to gather information, employing human crews onboard piloted by trained aviators who are responsible for the navigation, control, and operation of the aircraft, providing a broader perspective of large marine areas. Manned aircraft are operated by maritime domain awareness (MDA) organizations such as national coast guards and can detect vessel location and activity from a distance.

##### **Monitoring Capabilities**

The capabilities of manned aircraft allow for effective surveillance over large maritime areas, even in low-light conditions, aiding in the monitoring of various IUU fishing activities, including unauthorized fishing in prohibited areas, illegal gear use, quota violations, unreported fishing catch, vessel identification violations, transshipment at sea, and bycatch violations.

Depending on their intended mission and payload capacity, manned aircraft can range from smaller patrol aircraft, such as turboprop planes or light helicopters, to larger fixed-wing aircraft such as maritime patrol aircraft or surveillance planes. The weight of manned aircraft can vary significantly, as smaller patrol aircraft may weigh between a few thousand kilograms to tens of thousands of kilograms for larger maritime patrol aircraft. Endurance for maritime patrol aircraft can span between several hours to over 10-12 hours, and the range of manned aircraft can extend into thousands of nautical miles, depending on factors such as fuel efficiency, fuel capacity, and mission requirements.
